# Instructions to generate regional cut out configuration of ECCO-Darwin

Authors: Cl√©ment Bertin, Michael Wood, Dustin Carroll

## Getting Started
This repository has been created to guide the ECCO-Darwin users in generating their own regional configuration of the global ECCO-Darwin simulation.

To generate the regional configuration you will need:
- Capabilities to run the ECCO-Darwin model (in the following we use NAS Pleiades supercomputer)
- Python3 and an Anaconda environment (Instructions to create the environment will follow)

## Main steps
The instruction file is organised as follows:
- Extracting the boundaries conditions
